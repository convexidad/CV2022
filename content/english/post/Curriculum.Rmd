Thumbnails can be enabled easily by setting the `thumbnail` parameter in the frontmatter to an image such as `"images/landscape.jpg"`.

Make sure to copy the image the `static/images/` directory.

If put together, it will look like this (that's in fact this post's frontmatter):


```{r}
xfun::pkg_load2(c("htmltools", "mime"))
xfun::embed_file("CV-7.pdf")
getwd()
```
